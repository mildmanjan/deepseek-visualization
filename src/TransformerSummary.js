      <div className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Overview</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" introduced the Transformer, a neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing and laid the groundwork for models like GPT, BERT, and DeepSeek.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike previous approaches that used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Transformer relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw relationships between input and output elements, regardless of their distance in a sequence.

            <h3 className="font-medium mb-2">Self-Attention Mechanism</h3>
            <p className="text-sm">
              The core innovation of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing each word. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies much more effectively than previous architectures.

          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-2">Multi-Head Attention</h3>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Rather than performing a single attention function, Transformers use multiple "attention heads" that process the input in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously and capture various types of relationships.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-2">Positional Encoding</h3>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Since the Transformer doesn't process data sequentially like RNNs, it needs a way to understand the order of words. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each token in the sequence.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-medium mb-2">Parallelization</h3>
            <p className="text-sm">
              By eliminating recurrence, Transformers can process all tokens in parallel, dramatically speeding up training and enabling much larger models to be trained efficiently.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Impact on AI Development</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Transformer architecture has had a profound impact on AI development:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>It enabled the training of increasingly large language models, from BERT (340M parameters) to GPT-3 (175B parameters) to DeepSeek (671B parameters)</li>
          <li>It dramatically improved performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering</li>
          <li>It provided the foundation for models that demonstrate emergent capabilities like few-shot learning and reasoning</li>
          <li>Its attention mechanism has been adapted for computer vision, audio processing, and multimodal AI systems</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Connection to DeepSeek</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          DeepSeek builds upon the Transformer architecture with several optimizations:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for reducing memory requirements during training and inference</li>
          <li>Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to efficiently scale to hundreds of billions of parameters</li>
          <li>Specialized quantization techniques to reduce computational requirements</li>
          <li>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve reasoning capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          These advancements have allowed DeepSeek to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating how the original Transformer architecture continues to evolve and improve.
